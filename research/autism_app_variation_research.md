# Autism-Friendly Variation: Motivator App Research

**Research Question:** How can the Motivator App be adapted to help people with autism stay on track with tasks?

---

## Key Findings: Autism & Task Management Challenges

### Executive Function Difficulties

Approximately **70-80% of autistic people** experience executive function challenges, which directly impact:

- **Task initiation** (difficulty starting tasks, even when motivated)
- **Time management** and time blindness (difficulty gauging how long tasks take)
- **Transitioning** between activities
- **Working memory** (keeping track of multiple steps or appointments)
- **Planning and prioritization** (determining what to do first)
- **Organization** (managing materials, deadlines, and belongings)

### Communication & Language Processing

Autistic adults typically:

- **Process language literally** (struggle with metaphors, sarcasm, idioms, abstract language)
- Prefer **direct, clear, and explicit communication**
- Are **facts-focused and honest** in communication style
- May need **extra processing time** for instructions
- Benefit from **written over verbal** instructions (reduces memory burden)
- Prefer **predictable, consistent** messaging

### Sensory & Interface Considerations

Autistic users benefit from:

- **Low-sensory design** (minimal visual clutter, clean interfaces)
- **Customizable sensory settings** (dark mode, reduced animations, adjustable colors)
- **Predictable layouts** (consistent navigation, no surprise changes)
- **Visual organization** (color coding, icons, timelines)
- **Reduced cognitive load** (simple, clear information hierarchy)

## What Works: Autism-Friendly App Features

### 1. Visual Supports & Structure

**What autistic users need:**
- Visual schedules and timelines
- Color-coded task categories
- Icons and symbols (not just text)
- Visual timers showing time passing
- Checklists with clear completion indicators

**Why it works:** Makes abstract concepts like time and sequence concrete and visible.

### 2. Clear, Literal, Direct Language

**What autistic users need:**
- No metaphors, idioms, or sarcasm
- Explicit instructions ("Click the blue button" not "Take the next step")
- Concrete language ("You have 15 minutes" not "Time is running out")
- Predictable phrasing (consistent wording for similar messages)

**Why it works:** Reduces cognitive load from interpreting ambiguous or figurative language.

### 3. Customization & Control

**What autistic users need:**
- Adjustable notification frequency
- Control over sensory elements (sounds, vibrations, animations)
- Ability to turn off specific features
- Customizable color schemes
- Choice of communication style

**Why it works:** Allows users to adapt the app to their specific sensory and cognitive needs.

### 4. Task Breakdown & Step-by-Step Guidance

**What autistic users need:**
- Large tasks broken into smaller, manageable steps
- Sequential instructions (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3)
- Clear start and end points
- Progress indicators

**Why it works:** Reduces overwhelm and supports executive function challenges with initiation and planning.

### 5. Routine Support & Predictability

**What autistic users need:**
- Consistent daily routines
- Advance notice of changes
- Recurring task templates
- Time-based anchors (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Day-of-week patterns (Monday = X, Tuesday = Y)

**Why it works:** Predictability reduces anxiety and supports executive function.

### 6. Gentle, Non-Judgmental Feedback

**What autistic users need:**
- Positive reinforcement without pressure
- No guilt-tripping or shame-based motivation
- Acknowledgment of effort, not just results
- Option to skip without penalty
- Emotional regulation support

**Why it works:** Many autistic adults experience burnout from masking and high expectations; gentle support prevents additional stress.

## What DOESN'T Work for Autistic Users

### ❌ Avoid These Approaches:

1. **Sarcasm, irony, or "tough love"** - Likely to be interpreted literally and cause confusion or distress
2. **Metaphors and idioms** - "Crush it," "nail it," "kill it" may be confusing or distressing
3. **Ambiguous language** - "Soon," "later," "in a bit" (use specific times instead)
4. **Excessive notifications** - Can cause sensory overload and anxiety
5. **Unpredictable changes** - Sudden interface updates or message variations
6. **Social pressure tactics** - "Everyone else is doing this" may increase anxiety
7. **Overly complex gamification** - Too many rules, points, levels can be overwhelming
8. **Tone-based communication** - Autistic people often struggle with interpreting tone

## Autism-Friendly Motivator App Variation: Key Adaptations

### Communication Style: "Clear & Supportive"

**Core Principles:**
- Literal, direct language
- No sarcasm, metaphors, or idioms
- Concrete time references
- Predictable phrasing
- Gentle, non-judgmental tone

**Example Messages:**

**Task Reminder (15 minutes before):**
- ✅ "Your meeting starts in 15 minutes. You have time to prepare."
- ❌ "Time to crush that meeting!" (metaphor, ambiguous)

**Task Initiation Support:**
- ✅ "It's 9:00 AM. Time to start your first task: Make 5 prospecting calls."
- ❌ "Let's-a-go! Your task is waiting!" (idiom, unclear)

**Task Completion:**
- ✅ "Task complete. You made 5 calls. Well done."
- ❌ "Boom! You crushed it!" (metaphor, exclamation may feel overwhelming)

**Gentle Nudge:**
- ✅ "You planned to start this task at 10:00 AM. It's now 10:15 AM. Would you like to start now?"
- ❌ "Stop procrastinating. Move." (judgmental, pressure)

**Missed Task:**
- ✅ "You didn't complete this task today. That's okay. Would you like to reschedule it?"
- ❌ "You skipped this. Your goals are waiting." (guilt-inducing)

---

### Visual Design: Low-Sensory, High-Clarity

**Interface Features:**
- Minimal animations (or option to disable)
- High contrast, clear fonts
- Consistent layout (no surprise changes)
- Color-coded categories (user-defined)

- Icon-based navigation
- Dark mode option
- Adjustable text size

**Visual Timer:**
- Show time remaining visually (pie chart, bar)
- Use specific numbers ("12 minutes left")
- Optional auditory cues (gentle chime, not alarm)

---

### Task Structure: Step-by-Step Breakdown

**Feature: Task Decomposition**

When user creates a task, app prompts:
- "Break this into smaller steps? (Recommended)"
- User can add steps or use AI suggestions

**Example:**
- Main task: "Prepare for client meeting"
- Step 1: Review client file (10 min)
- Step 2: Prepare 3 questions (5 min)
- Step 3: Print documents (5 min)
- Step 4: Set up meeting room (5 min)

**Each step gets its own reminder and completion checkbox.**

---

### Routine Builder: Predictable Patterns

**Feature: Daily Routine Templates**

User creates routine once, app repeats it:
- Morning routine: Wake → Shower → Breakfast → Review schedule
- Work routine: Prospecting calls → Email → Lunch → Client meetings
- Evening routine: Dinner → Review tomorrow → Relaxation → Sleep

**Visual schedule shows:**
- What's happening now (highlighted)
- What's next (preview)
- What's later (grayed out)

**Advance notice of changes:**
- "Tomorrow's schedule is different: You have an early meeting at 8 AM instead of 9 AM."

---

### Customization: User Control

**Settings Options:**

**Notification Frequency:**
- Minimal (1-2 per day)

- Time format: 12-hour / 24-hour
- Date format: MM/DD/YYYY / DD/MM/YYYY
- Emoji: Show / Hide

---

### Emotional Regulation Support

**Feature: Check-In Prompts**

App asks periodically:
- "How are you feeling right now?"
- Options: Calm / Focused / Stressed / Overwhelmed / Tired

**If user selects "Overwhelmed" or "Stressed":**
- App suggests: "Would you like to take a 5-minute break?"
- Offers: Breathing exercise / Quiet time / Reschedule task

**If user selects "Tired":**
- App suggests: "Would you like to move this task to later today or tomorrow?"

---

### Feedback System: Non-Judgmental

**Post-Task Popup (Autism Variation):**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓ Task Complete                    │
│                                      │
│  "Client Meeting - Acme Corp"       │
│                                      │
│  You completed this task.           │
│                                      │
│  Did the reminder help you?         │
│                                      │
│  ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐      │
│  │   YES    │    │    NO    │      │
│  └──────────┘    └──────────┘      │
│                                      │
│         [Skip]                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key differences from standard version:**
- No emoji (can be overwhelming)
- Simple, clear language
- No exclamation points (can feel intense)
- No gamification language ("XP," "streak")
- Option to skip without guilt
